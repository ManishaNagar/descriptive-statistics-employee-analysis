# Employee Data Analysis using Descriptive Statistics

## Project Overview

This project performs descriptive statistical analysis on an employee dataset to understand relationships between age, salary, and lifestyle factors. The analysis uses Python and data visualization techniques to identify patterns and trends in employee compensation and behavior.

---

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains information about employees, including:

* Age
* Salary
* Healthy eating score
* Active lifestyle score
* Employee group/category

Total records: 50 employees

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* Load and explore the dataset
* Perform descriptive statistical analysis
* Visualize relationships between variables
* Identify patterns in employee salary and lifestyle
* Perform correlation analysis between features

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab
* GitHub

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Checked dataset shape, columns, and information
* Used describe() to calculate statistical measures

### 2. Data Visualization

Created visualizations including:

* Scatter plot (Age vs Salary)
* Scatter plot (Healthy Eating vs Active Lifestyle)
* Scatter plot (Healthy Eating vs Salary)
* Count plot (Employee groups)
* Histogram (Salary distribution)

### 3. Correlation Analysis

* Generated correlation heatmap
* Identified relationships between numerical features

### 4. Data Subsetting

* Filtered employees based on healthy eating score
* Filtered employees based on salary conditions
* Combined multiple conditions for analysis

---

## Key Findings

* Salary tends to increase with age
* Healthy eating and active lifestyle show positive correlation
* Certain employee groups dominate the dataset
* Correlation heatmap helped identify feature relationships
* Some employees have lower salary despite good lifestyle scores
